-- subquery as a table
-- Reshape your data
-- like wide to long
-- Prefiltering

-- 在FROM裡面，你可以放多個subquery，所以記得給他們別名
-- 也要記得，你的subquery是可以被JOIN的，不管是和原本的table，還是其他subquery



-- subquery JOIN
SELECT
	-- Select country name and the count match IDs
    c.name AS country_name,
    COUNT(sub.id) AS matches
FROM country AS c
-- Inner join the subquery onto country
-- Select the country id and match id columns
INNER JOIN (SELECT country_id,id
           FROM match
           -- Filter the subquery by matches with 10+ goals
           WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10) AS sub
ON c.id = sub.country_id
GROUP BY c.id;


-- subquery FROM

SELECT
	-- Select country, date, home, and away goals from the subquery
    country,
    date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal
FROM 
	-- Select country name, date, and total goals in the subquery
	(SELECT c.name AS country, 
     	    m.date, 
     		m.home_goal, 
     		m.away_goal,
           (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN country AS c
    ON m.country_id = c.id) AS subq
-- Filter by total goals scored in the main query
